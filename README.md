# CNProj_IntranetMailingSystem
Bulding multiple-client server system using socket programming.  When a client tries to send a mail to other client,  the message first goes to the mail server, that stores the message in a sql database. And when a new client connects, server queries the database and retrieves all mails of that client (displays inbox of that client)
